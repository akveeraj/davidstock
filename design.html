Design Service Information</font></b>

<blockquote>
<b><font face="Times" size=4>
Clients</font></b><br>

<font FACE="Times" size=2>
Clients fall into one of the following categories:

<ul>
<li>Those opening brand new premises, in need of a complete turnkey
(start to finish) project.
<li>Those wishing to upgrade their existing premises
<li>Those requiring new fixtures/fittings/display furniture, etc.
</ul>

</font>

<p>

<b><font face="Times" size=4>
Design Procedure</font></b><br>

<font FACE="Times" size=2>
Once you have identified your need from the above list, the next step is
to form in your mind an idea as to what you want your new
premises/cabinets to be along the lines of (ie, traditional, contemporary,
complete one-off, etc.) and the more information you can provide at the
start of a project, the more smoothly a project will run, saving time
and money.

<p>

The information you gather and supply to the designer is commonly known as
a <i>design brief</i>.

</font>

<p>

<b><font face="Times" size=4>
Design Brief</font></b><br>

<font FACE="Times" size=2>
The design brief includes information such as

<ul>
<li>Style of interior required
<li>Type of clientele/customer to be catered for
<li>Type/lines of jewellery being sold
<li>Preferable colour schemes
<li>Security considerations
<li>Local planning considerations
<li>Approximate budget available
</ul>

<p>

Once the design brief as been taken from the client, the rest of the
design procedure is continued in the following order:

</font>

<p>

<b><font face="Times" size=4>
Sketch Work</font></b><br>

<font FACE="Times" size=2>
The sketch work allows the Client to establish and agree upon basic
likes/dislikes/finishes/appearance of the interior/cabinets, etc.

</font>

<p>

<b><font face="Times" size=4>
Perspective Drawings</font></b><br>

<font FACE="Times" size=2>
Perspective line drawings or perspective coloured visuals are
carried out once a general design and finish has been agreed upon in order
to give the client a better idea of the finished look.

<b><font face="Times" size=4>
Full Working Drawings</font></b><br>

<font FACE="Times" size=2>
Full working drawings/elevations are carried out once designs have been
agreed upon in order to give an accurate picture of the completed project,
to help establish the price of the work to be carried out and usually to
act as workshop drawings from which items can be manufactured.
